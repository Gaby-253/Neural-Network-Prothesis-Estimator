# Neural-Network-Prothesis-Estimator
This project is a use-case study from an facility in France. 
This facility create myoelectric prothesis for amputed people that have the shoulder joint.
They create a dataset thanks to the Virtual Reality and Guys with sensors. In that way to see wich angle the arm did, and with wich effector's position is relied. 
They would like to estimate the 5 angles of prothesis arms by taking 7 inputs which are : (X,Y,Z,Roll,Pitch) Of the piece to take and the Shoulder Pitch and Roll of the amputed man.
